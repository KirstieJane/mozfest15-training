These are training materials for the Jupyter & Python workshop at Mozfest 2015.
They are based on [Software Carpentry lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html).

If you're familiar with git, please clone this repository. If not, click the
'Download ZIP' button on the right, and then unzip the materials onto your
computer.

We won't use all of this material in the training session; you're welcome to
work through more of it individually if you're interested.

There are many books and websites you can use to learn more about Python and the
SciPy ecosystem. Here's a few:

- [Codeacademy Python track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) - if you're new to programming
- [Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/)
- [Pandas tutorials](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
